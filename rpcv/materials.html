<!--<h2>Info</h2>-->
<p class="introtext">The Paul D. Coverdell Fellows Program (formerly known as Fellows/USA) is a graduate fellowship program that offers financial assistance to returned Peace Corps Volunteers. All Fellows complete internships in underserved American communities, allowing them to bring home, and expand upon, the skills they learned as Volunteers. These skills in adapting to new cultures, developing and managing projects, dealing with language barriers, and leveraging limited resources attract the attention of prospective schools. Since the inception of the Coverdell Fellows Program, nearly 4,000 returned Volunteers have participated in the program and made a difference across the country.

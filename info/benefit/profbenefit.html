<h2>During Service</h2>
<ul class="infolist">
  <li><strong>Peace Corps Training: </strong>Peace Corps volunteers are trained before and during service. Training begins in the U.S. with a brief pre-departure orientation. Then, Peace Corps provides two-three months of training in the country in which Volunteers are assigned to serve. Volunteers study together and receive intensive instruction in the local language, technical skills related to their job, how to adopt practices to enhance their safety and well being, and become familiar with the country’s cultural traditions. During this time, most volunteers live with host families to fully immerse themselves in the new culture. At the completion of training, Volunteers possess the language, technical, and cross-cultural skills necessary to begin their work in their individual sites. Over the next 24 months of service, the Peace Corps provides Volunteers with regular opportunities to reinforce existing skills and gain new skills related to work, language, culture, and safety. </li>
</ul>
<h2>After Service</h2>

<ul class="infolist">
<li><strong>
Skills for the Global Marketplace: </strong>Peace Corps provides training in a foreign language, technical skills, and cross-cultural understanding to all Volunteers. This, combined with the experience of living, learning, and working with a community overseas for 27 months, augments any career path. Whether you are just out of college, mid-career, or retired, the new skills you learn in the Peace Corps can help you achieve long-term career goals by enhancing your marketability to employers.</li><li><strong>
Receive Advantages in Federal Employment: </strong>Volunteers who complete two years of service receive one year of noncompetitive eligibility for employment in the federal government. This means that at the hiring agency’s discretion, if a Volunteer meets the minimum qualifications for a position, he or she can be hired without going through the standard competitive process. Those who are employed by the federal government after their Peace Corps service can receive credit toward retirement for  those years of Volunteer service.</li><li><strong>
Career Support After Service:</strong> When Volunteers return to the U.S., Peace Corps Returned Volunteer Services (RVS) provides transition assistance related to jobs and education. RVS publishes online job announcements, graduate school information, and career-related articles and advice. They also sponsor career events throughout the year in cities around the country to help returned Volunteers translate their field experience for prospective employers and other professional contacts.</li><li><strong>
Employment Opportunities at Peace Corps Partner Organizations: </strong>The Peace Corps has partnerships with other federal agencies, international and domestic nongovernmental organizations, volunteering and service organizations, minority higher education institutions, and other domestic nonprofits. Your Peace Corps service strengthens your competitiveness for employment with these organizations. View a list of these partner organizations on the Peace Corps website.</li><li><strong>
Be Part of a Vibrant Network: </strong>extend your Volunteer experience by being part of the more than 210,000 returned Volunteers, many of whom actively participate in local returned Peace Corps Volunteer (RPCV) groups.</li><li><strong>
Unique Opportunity for Short-Term Assignments: </strong>Peace Corps Response is a program that offers short-term, high-impact assignments for returned Volunteers and other experienced professionals. Positions average six months in length and are designed to address development needs as identified by the host country.

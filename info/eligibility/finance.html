<p>
A Peace Corps applicant must not have any financial or other legal obligations that cannot be satisfied or postponed during the period of Peace Corps service.
</p>   
<h2>General Debt/Loans</h2>

<p>
If you currently have a financial obligation that will be paid prior to departure, you must provide a statement outlining how you plan to satisfy these obligations prior to the beginning of your service. If you currently have a financial obligation that will be ongoing during Peace Corps service, you must provide a statement outlining how you plan to satisfy these obligations while service without salary in the Peace Corps. Any financial obligations must be acknowledged and accounted for. More information about the required documentation for specific types of loans can be found on the Peace Corps website.
</p>       

<h2>Student Loans</h2>

<p>
Volunteers who have outstanding student loans under one of the federally administered or guaranteed student loan programs qualify for certain relief during their Peace Corps service. Student loans may be deferred for the full period of Volunteer service, up to 27 months. Some lenders require volunteers to reapply for a deferment every 12 months. It is the responsibility of the applicant to verify their eligibility for loan deferment and apply for student loan deferment from their lenders. Different rules qualify for each type of loan, and greater detail can be found on the Peace Corps website.

<p>
 A DD-214 form will be collected from all applicants discharged from any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in the last 10 years from the date of the submission of a Peace Corps Application if the individual’s discharge type was anything other than “honorable”.
</p>   
<h2>Active Duty</h2>

<p>
Individuals on active military service in the U.S. Armed Forces are ineligible for invitation for Peace Corps service. An individual can begin their application, but must document that they will be transferred out of the armed forces and will not have any military obligations that will disrupt their ability to begin and complete Peace Corps service. This can be done using a DD-214 Form.
</p>       

<h2>National Guard/Reserves</h2>

<p>
Applicants serving on the National Guard or the Ready Reserves may be nominated and considered for an invitation for Peace Corps service. They must, however, provide a written statement from their commanding officer stating that “their presence will not be required by their military unit for the duration of their Peace Corps service, except in case of national emergency”. If an applicant is transferred from active duty to Ready Reserves, the applicant must provide documentation of the transfer from active duty and do not need a letter from their commanding officer.

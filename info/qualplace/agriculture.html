Volunteers work alongside local farmers and families to increase food security and production while promoting environmental conservation practices. Volunteers introduce small-scale farmers to techniques that prevent soil erosion, reduce the use of harmful pesticides, and replenish the soil. Agriculture projects often integrate vegetable gardening, livestock management, agroforestry, and food security. Volunteers promote health nutrition and can also promote the implementation of agribusiness programs to market and sell surplus food and cash crops.

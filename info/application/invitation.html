The placement officer will extend an invitation in writing for a specific country and provide a detailed job description to the applicant. The electronic invitation letter includes the date of departure, the program job assignment, and links to a welcome packet that includes a Welcome book with details about the country where you will serve, a volunteer handbook, and more. If you accept your invitation to serve as a Volunteer, the Peace Corps will send you more information about your host country, and provide information on your pre-service orientation training (Staging) and departure.

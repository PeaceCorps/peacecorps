A nomination is a recommendation for an applicant to move to the next stage of the application process. This next step includes legal clearance, suitability, technical skills review, and the final medical clearance. An applicant’s legal clearance will be based on the information they have provided based on marital status, financial obligations, previous legal history, dependents, etc. Competitive applicants who are medically pre-qualified and legally cleared for service are then evaluated for service by a Peace Corps placement officer. Taking into account each applicant’s skills and departure dates, placement officers match applicants to openings in different countries.

A nomination is a recommendation for an applicant to move to the next stage of the application process. This next step includes legal clearance, suitability, technical skills review, and the final medical clearance. An applicant’s legal clearance will be based on the information they have provided based on marital status, financial obligations, previous legal history, dependents, etc. Competitive applicants who are medically pre-qualified and legally cleared for service are then evaluated for service by a Peace Corps placement officer. Taking into account each applicant’s skills and departure dates, placement officers match applicants to openings in different countries.

<h2>Selection and Placement</h2>
<p>How and where the Peace Corps assigns Volunteers to work is based largely on:
</p>
<ul class="infolist">
<li>How well your skills match the open positions we have</li><li>
How your skills compare to those of other candidates</li><li>
Your availability and suitability, and the start date of open positions</li><li>
Where and what support is available should you have special medical requirements</li></ul>
<p>
The more flexible you are about where you serve, the easier you are to place. Each year, Peace Corps places thousands of Volunteers in positions that have been created in collaboration with the countries requesting assistance. The start dates for these positions depend on the country and the job.

<p>How and where the Peace Corps assigns Volunteers to work is based largely on:
</p>
<ul class="infolist">
<li>How well your skills match the open positions we have</li><li>
How your skills compare to those of other candidates</li><li>
Your availability and suitability, and the start date of open positions</li><li>
Where and what support is available should you have special medical requirements</li></ul>
<p>
The more flexible you are about where you serve, the easier you are to place. Each year, Peace Corps places thousands of Volunteers in positions that have been created in collaboration with the countries requesting assistance. The start dates for these positions depend on the country and the job.

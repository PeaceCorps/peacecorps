The first step toward becoming a Peace Corps volunteer is to complete an online Peace Corps application. The link can be found on the Peace Corps website.  A completed application includes:
</p>       
<ul class="infolist">
<li>Two essays</li>
<li>Three references</li>
<li>A resume including employment history, a list of community and volunteer activities, education background, and practical skills information</li>
<li>A copy of your college transcript (unless you have 10 years of applicable professional experience)</li>
<li>Outstanding financial obligation information (including student loans and mortgage)</li>
<li>Documentation on outstanding legal information</li>
<li>A completed Health History Form</li>
</ul>             

<p class="note">You do not need to complete your application in one session, but you must access your application every 30 days or your application will become inactive and you will need to start again. </p>

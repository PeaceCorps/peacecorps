<p>The Peace Corps has ten core expectations for volunteers in promoting world peace:</p>
<ol class="infolist"><li> Prepare your personal and professional life to make a commitment 
    to serve abroad for a full term of 27 months</li>
    <li> Commit to improving the quality of life of the people with whom 
        you live and work; and, in doing so, share your skills, adapt them, 
        and learn new skills as needed.</li>
    <li> Serve where the Peace Corps asks you to go, under conditions of 
        hardship, if necessary, and with the flexibility needed for effective 
        service.</li>
    <li> Recognize that your successful and sustainable development work 
        is based on the local trust and confidence you build by living in, 
        and respectfully integrating yourself into, your host community 
        and culture.</li>
    <li>Recognize that you are responsible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week 
        for your personal conduct and professional performance.</li>
    <li>Engage with host country partners in a spirit of cooperation, mutual 
        learning, and respect.</li>
    <li>Work within the rules and regulations of the Peace Corps and the local 
        and national laws of the country where you serve.</li>
    <li>Exercise judgment and personal responsibility to protect your health, 
        safety, and well-being and that of others.</li>
    <li>Recognize that you will be perceived, in your host country and 
        community, as a representative of the people, cultures, values, and 
        traditions of the United States of America.</li>
    <li>Represent responsibly the people, cultures, values, and traditions of 
        your host country and community to people in the United States both 
        during and following your service.</li>

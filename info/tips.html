<h2>Tips for the Application Process</h2>
<ol class="infolist">
    <li>Take the time to proofread both essays for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and to make sure you have answered the essay questions entirely.</li><li>
Please make sure to be as detailed and as accurate as possible on the Heath History Form as to avoid possible future paperwork.
</li><li>    Be sure to attach all applicable documents to your application; transcripts, test scores, marriage certificates, resume, Masters Programs acceptance letters, certifications (such as First Aid or TOEFL), all notarized letters, etc.
</li><li>    Be sure to scan, upload and attach your transcripts to your online application in a program in which the document cannot be edited. (For example, it cannot be in Microsoft Word, but it can be in Preview).
</li><li>     Take the time to make sure your resume is in a professional format before you upload and attach it to your application.
</li><li>     When completing the “Assignments and Regional Interests” section of the application, keep in mind that the more flexible you are in terms of sector assignment, departure date, and region, the more competitive you are as an applicant and the more likely that Peace Corps will be able to match you to a volunteer assignment.
</li><li>    Give the people you are requesting references from plenty of time to complete their reference forms. Also, make sure that they complete and submit their reference information close to the time that you submit your application.
</li><li>   Interviews are to be treated like any other professional interview. Dress professionally, arrive on time, be prepared to answer and ask questions.
</li><li> Continue to check for emails from Peace Corps requesting updated information, follow-up paperwork, and other information that may be required for your application to continue through the application process. 
</li><li>     During the entire application process, make an effort to update important information in your application and to your recruiter. If your address, email address, and/or phone number have changed, please make the effort to notify your recruiter about that change. Also, notify your recruiter if you will be out of the country or out of contact for an extended period of time. </li>

<!--<h2>Summary</h2>-->
<p>Applying to become a volunteer takes on average 7-12 months from the day an individual submits an application to the day they board the plane to begin service. For some applicants, it may take longer due to the number of positions available, determination of applicant suitability, and time for medical evaluation. </p>
